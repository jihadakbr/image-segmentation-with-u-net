## Objective


The main objective is to construct a U-Net, a specialized type of CNN designed for fast and precise image segmentation. Using this U-Net, I will predict a label for each individual pixel in an image, specifically images from a self-driving car dataset.

Semantic image segmentation, the task at hand, is similar to object detection but takes a more precise approach. It aims to identify objects in an image and label each pixel with its corresponding class, creating a precise mask for each object. This pixel-perfect understanding of the environment is crucial for self-driving cars, enabling them to make informed decisions such as changing lanes and avoiding obstacles, ensuring safety.

Throughout this assignment, I will achieve the following key goals: building a U-Net, a specialized CNN for image segmentation; understanding the differences between a regular CNN and a U-Net in the context of image segmentation; implementing semantic image segmentation on the CARLA self-driving car dataset; and applying sparse categorical crossentropy for pixelwise prediction, ensuring accurate pixel-level classification.

By the end of this assignment, I will have gained valuable skills in constructing U-Nets and applying semantic image segmentation, making significant progress in developing advanced image analysis techniques for self-driving cars.
